# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- Entries must be of this form :

```md
#### [Item Name](link-to-wikipedia)

> A one-line description of the item

Succinct paragraph about the entry. (wrapped at 80 columns)

[Reference Name 1](some-other-reference)

[Reference Name 2](some-other-reference-1)
```

- **Reference Naming Guidelines**: If the article has a title that is related to the item
in self explanatory way (such as `What is item-name?`, or `How item-name works?`, then, the source of
the article must be mentioned in the format:  
```md
R: source-of-article.com
```
If not, then the title of the article may be used.  
```md
R: Title of the article
```
)
- You may shorten the name of the item to a suitable acronym for use in the item's entry. (Check [DKE](https://github.com/icyflame/awesome-social-scienc#dunning-kruger-effect-dke))
- Every entry must have atleast one reference apart from WikiPedia.
- If the entry does not have a wikipedia page, then consider [writing one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).
- If the existence of a particular effect is popularly debated, then please
    mention the views of the critics in the succinct paragraph about the item.
- You may add atmost three references, in one line.
- A **soft upper bound** on references is 6. (excluding WikiPedia)
- If your entry consists of an image, put the image inside the `img/` directory,
    with the name of your entry.
